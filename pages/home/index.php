        We are still only junior web developers but very agile. We both learn at the John von Neumann University and we both already have certificate as <strong>System Administrator</strong>. As for <strong>Viktor</strong>, he's really into at Lego models. He already designed 5 LEGO models for their children. It means from spacing from simple brick models to motorized Technic devices and advanced Lego-BOOST and Mindstorms robot creations. As for <strong>Dénes</strong>, he is really into web developing. He is the maintenance guy for the Hospital of Nagykőrös's web page since 2019. The page is following the minimalist design trend of today. In the pandemic period, he created a vaccination registration page too which was good job according to others.<br>And this is our common work for Erasmus Web Programming 1.
